# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Arnau Gelonch, and I love working with the MERN stack, as well as exploring the world of finances and data analysis using Python. In this README, I'll provide you with an overview of my interests and projects related to these areas. So, let's dive in!

## MERN Stack

The MERN stack is one of my preferred technology stacks for building web applications. MERN stands for:

- **M**ongoDB: A flexible and scalable NoSQL database solution.
- **E**xpress.js: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
- **R**eact.js: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **N**ode.js: A runtime environment for server-side JavaScript.

I enjoy leveraging the strengths of each component in the stack to create robust and efficient web applications. You can explore my repositories to find MERN-based projects that I've worked on.

## Finances and Data Analysis with Python

Apart from web development, I have a keen interest in finances and data analysis. Python, with its rich ecosystem of libraries, is my go-to language for these domains. Here are some aspects related to finances and data analysis that fascinate me:

- **Financial Data Visualization**: I love creating visually appealing charts and graphs to analyze and interpret financial data. Tools like `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` are my favorites in this area.

- **Data Manipulation and Analysis**: Python provides powerful libraries such as `Pandas` for data manipulation, transformation, and analysis. I enjoy exploring datasets, performing calculations, and extracting meaningful insights.

## Startup Development

I'm currently working on an exciting startup project in the finance, economic and geopolitical industry. The goal is to provide a comprehensive and affordable data analysis solution tailored for startups. Here's an overview of my startup development focus:

- **Data Analysis for Finance**: My startup focuses on developing a data analysis platform specifically designed to meet the needs of expert and beginner analysts on financial, economical and geopolitical sectors. The platform aims to empower people to analyze financial, economical and geopolitical data, gain valuable insights, and make data-driven decisions.

- **Affordability and Accessibility**: I believe in providing affordable and accessible solutions for peole. My startup aims to offer a cost-effective pricing model that ensures people can benefit from advanced data analysis capabilities without breaking their budget.

- **Full Graphical Experience with D3 Charts**: Visualizing data effectively is crucial in data analysis. To provide a compelling user experience, my startup leverages the power of D3.js, a popular JavaScript library for creating interactive and visually stunning charts. This allows people to explore data in a rich graphical format.

I'm dedicated to developing innovative solutions that empower people in the finance, economic and geopolitical industry, and my startup project reflects that commitment.
